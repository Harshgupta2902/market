One should find local brokers who act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers."

The buyback reduces the number of shares in the market, and if the company stays bullish on its operations, it can help boost the proportion of earnings. The company files a letter of offer with SEBI, specifying the ratio of shares, the number of shares, buyback amount, buyback type, record date, and open and close dates. The buyback process occurs in the open market according to the schedule."

                    "answer": "Companies may offer a premium in buybacks to incentivize investors to participate. For example, if a company offers a buyback at Rs.1000 against the current market price of Rs.600, investors receive a Rs.400 premium per share in addition to the holding price. This can attract more investors to participate in the buyback offer."

The companies should draft DRHP with SEBI for Initial Public Offer (IPO) to change their company identity from Private Limited to Limited. The company should file DRHP (draft red herring prospectus) and final RHP (red herring prospectus) for IPO. SEBI approves the Initial Public Offer for the companies, and then they go for the IPO.

Investments are done over different market cycles, benefiting from the rupee-cost averaging factor. SIP allows staying invested for a longer period, giving your money time to enjoy the power of compounding. One can start SIP with a very small investment, making it more accessible."

SIP offers the benefit of not needing to time the market, as investments are systematic through market ups and downs, resulting in a weighted average return. Lumpsum requires market timing for potentially higher returns."

In our Lumpsum Calculator, you need to just enter the required inputs such as the amount you are willing to invest, the time period (in years) you are willing to stay invested and, the expected rate of return per annum that you think the investment will generate. After entering the required variables, the calculator will give you the future value of your investments. The formula that we have used in this Lumpsum Calculator is: Value = Investment*(1+R)^N"

                    "answer": "Ideally any investment (whether lumpsum or SIP) should be done keeping in mind various things like current income, risk profile, age, tax constraints, liquidity needs, time frame and certain other unique constraints. Lumpsum investment is preferred when one has a large amount of surplus funds and more importantly if he/she thinks that the market has majorly corrected or it won’t fall just after making the investment. Lumpsum investment done over a longer period helps generate compounding rate of returns."

                    "question": "What’s the difference between Lumpsum and SIP?",
                    "answer": "In lumpsum investment one needs to invest only once whereas, in SIP or Systematic Investment Plan one invests a fixed amount periodically. In lumpsum investment style the market condition plays a huge role because if the market makes a major correction after your investment, then it might take a few years to reach your original investment amount. Whereas, in SIP or systematic investment style one need not worry about timing the market as the investment is made during both ups and downs of the market. Therefore, the return generated is weighted average return."
